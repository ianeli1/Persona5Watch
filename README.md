# Persona 5 Watch Face

This is a quick mod done in like an hour and you really shouldn't use it as it hasn't been optimized at all. It's based on the Persona5 Weather Forecast repo by [caffi-nate](https://github.com/caffi-nate/Persona5-Weather-Forecast)

If you want to install this watch face, you'll probably need to set up Tizen Studio on your own and enable debugging on your Samsung Watch
